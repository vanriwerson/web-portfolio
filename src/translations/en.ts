    title: 'A bit of my story',
    content:
      'I was born in Limeira, in the countryside of São Paulo, and my first contact with technology came early in childhood through classic video games — Atari, Mega Drive, Super Nintendo, and even the nostalgic Brick Game. Since then, curiosity about how things work has followed me throughout life. \n Besides technology, I have always had a strong connection with the arts. I have studied music since I was 13 and have worked as a guitar and acoustic guitar teacher, as well as a musician and vocalist. These experiences strengthened my communication, empathy, and teamwork skills. I also volunteered teaching origami to children, which helped me develop the ability to explain concepts clearly and patiently. \n In 2018, I taught myself VBA to automate repetitive tasks at work and ended up creating a complete system for market research and purchase management. This project was my first step into software development and sparked my desire to go further. \n Wanting to share my creations beyond my own computer, I dove into web development through tutorials and online communities until I decided to formalize my training. I began a degree in Systems Analysis and Development in 2021 and later graduated as a Full Stack Web Developer from Trybe in 2023 — a journey marked by collaboration, agile methodologies, and hands-on learning. \n Today, I continue to grow as a developer, combining life experience, curiosity, and dedication to create clear, accessible, and efficient solutions.',

      'I am a full-stack web developer proficient in ReactJS with Material UI on the front-end and NodeJS with Express on the back-end. I also have experience designing and implementing relational databases. \n I have worked with several programming languages such as Java, Python, Golang, and more. I have also had experience with non-relational databases like MongoDB and Firebase — I believe that having a diverse toolbox is essential, even if some technologies are used more often than others. \n I have a natural preference for back-end development, especially when it involves relational databases. Still, as a developer, I see myself primarily as a problem-solver, regardless of where the challenges appear.',
